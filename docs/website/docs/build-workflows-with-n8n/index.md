title: Build Workflows with n8n
---

import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';

This tutorial will walk you through visually building a workflow using [n8n](https://n8n.io/) and the
[bonFHIR community node](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@bonfhir/n8n-nodes-bonfhir).

:::info[What is n8n?]

[n8n](https://n8n.io/) is a tool to design and execute workflows visually. It includes a lot of
[pre-built integrations](https://n8n.io/integrations/) to move and transform data between different apps and services.

It is also easily self-hostable (which allow you to make it HIPAA-compliant), and has both open-source and supported options.
