# BonFHIR UI Components

This Storybook illustrates BonFHIR UI component library.
At the moment, it only render controls using the `ui-mantine` package that leverages the [Mantine Component Library](https://mantine.dev/).

Please take some time to explorer the available components, organized within the following categories:

- Data Display: components that show FHIR [data types](https://hl7.org/fhir/datatypes.html) and [resources](https://hl7.org/fhir/resourcelist.html) in a read-only fashion
- Feedback: components that handle anything related to the loading / error / display / refresh lifecycle of screens
- Inputs: components dedicated to creating, updating and saving FHIR [data types](https://hl7.org/fhir/datatypes.html) and [resources](https://hl7.org/fhir/resourcelist.html)
- Navigation: components dedicated to the navigation around the app

Any interaction with a FHIR data source has been mocked for the purpose of focusing on the components themselves, and not the actual data.
