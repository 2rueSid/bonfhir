 * For a server, "supported by the system" means the system hosts/produces a set of
 * resources that are conformant to a particular profile, and allows clients that
 * use its services to search using this profile and to find appropriate data. For
 * a client, it means the system will search by this profile and process data
 * according to the guidance implicit in the profile. See further discussion in
 * [Using Profiles](profiling.html#profile-uses).
 * 
 * Supported profiles are different than the profile that applies to a particular
 * resource in .rest.resource.profile. The resource profile is a general statement
 * of what features of the resource are supported overall by the system - the sum
 * total of the facilities it supports. A supported profile is a deeper statement
 * about the functionality of the data and services provided by the server (or used
 * by the client). A typical case is a laboratory system that produces a set of
 * different reports - this is the list of types of data that it publishes. A key
 * aspect of declaring profiles here is the question of how the client converts
 * knowledge that the server publishes this data into working with the data; the
 * client can inspect individual resources to determine whether they conform to a
 * particular profile, but how does it find the ones that do? It does so by
 * searching using the _profile parameter, so any resources listed here must be
 * valid values for the _profile resource (using the identifier in the target
 * profile).

 *
