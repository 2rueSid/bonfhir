 * 5-10mg PO or 25mg PR bid prn nausea or vomiting".  In these cases, two
 * medication requests would be created that could be grouped together.  The
 * decision on which dose and route of administration to use is based on the
 * patient's condition at the time the dose is needed. In general, each prescribed
 * drug will be a separate Medication Request. 

When drug orders are grouped
 * together at the time of order entry,  but each of the drugs can be manipulated
 * independently e.g. changing the status of one order to "completed" or
 * "cancelled", changing another order status to "on-hold", the method to "group"
 * all of the medication requests together is to use
 * MedicationRequest.groupIdentifier element.  All of the orders grouped together
 * in this manner will have the same groupIdentifier, and separately, each order in
 * the group may have a unique identifier.  

There are cases that require grouping
 * of Medication orders together when it is necessary to specify optionality e.g.
 * order two drugs at one time, but stating either of these drugs may be used to
 * treat the patient.  The use of a RequestOrchestration should be used as a parent
 * for the Medication orders that require this type of grouping. An example when it
 * may be necessary to group medication orders together is when you specify timing
 * relationships e.g. order drug "xyz" with dose 123, then taper the same drug to a
 * different dose after some interval of time
precedence:
e.g. give drug "abc"
 * followed by drug "def"
e.g. give drug 30 minutes before some procedure was
 * performed
more generically this supports - hierarchical groups of actions, where
 * each specific action references the action to be performed (in terms of a
 * Request resource), and each group describes additional behavior, relationships,
 * and applicable conditions between the actions in the overall group.
Note that
 * one should NOT use the List or Composition resource to accomplish the above
 * requirements.  You may use List or Composition for other business requirements,

 * There is no requirement that a Reference.identifier point to something that is
 * actually exposed as a FHIR instance, but it SHALL point to a business concept
 * that would be expected to be exposed as a FHIR instance, and that instance would
 * need to be of a FHIR resource type allowed by the reference.
 * When an identifier is provided in place of a reference, any system processing
 * the reference will only be able to resolve the identifier to a reference if it
 * understands the business context in which the identifier is used. Sometimes this
 * is global (e.g. a national identifier) but often it is not. For this reason,
 * none of the useful mechanisms described for working with references (e.g.
 * chaining, includes) are possible, nor should servers be expected to be able
 * resolve the reference. Servers may accept an identifier based reference
 * untouched, resolve it, and/or reject it - see
 * CapabilityStatement.rest.resource.referencePolicy. 

When both an identifier and
 * a literal reference are provided, the literal reference is preferred.
 * Applications processing the resource are allowed - but not required - to check
 * that the identifier matches the literal reference

Applications converting a
 * logical reference to a literal reference may choose to leave the logical
 * reference present, or remove it.

Reference is intended to point to a structure
 * that can potentially be expressed as a FHIR resource, though there is no need
 * for it to exist as an actual FHIR resource instance - except in as much as an
 * application wishes to actual find the target of the reference. The content
 * referred to be the identifier must meet the logical constraints implied by any
 * limitations on what resource types are permitted for the reference.  For
 * example, it would not be legitimate to send the identifier for a drug
 * prescription if the type were Reference(Observation|DiagnosticReport).  One of
 * the use-cases for Reference.identifier is the situation where no FHIR
 * representation exists (where the type is Reference (Any).

This element only
 * allows for a single identifier. In the case where additional identifers are

 * The type this structure describes. If the derivation kind is 'specialization'

 * (a data type, an extension, a resource, including abstract ones). Otherwise the
 * structure definition is a constraint on the stated type (and in this case, the
 * type cannot be an abstract type).  References are URLs that are relative to
 * http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition e.g. "string" is a reference to
 * http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/string. Absolute URLs are only allowed
 * in logical models, where they are required.
 * Note that in the case of constraints, the type could be determined by chasing
 * through the baseDefinition references until a type defining structure
 * (derivation = specialization) is reached, or by looking at the path of the first
 * element in the snapshot - if present - but providing the type directly makes for
 * simpler tooling and indexing. 

The type must match the elements defined in the
 * differential and the snapshot. For all FHIR defined types, the path name of the
 * element will start with the type name. For logical models, where the type SHALL
 * be a fully specified URL, the type name SHOULD start with the final path segment
 * of the type URL where required. E.g. If the type was
 * "http://example.org/fhir/MyLogicalModelType", the type name should start with
