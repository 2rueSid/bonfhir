The `core` package provides primitives to easily manipulate FHIR resources.  
It is also used as a common dependency that most other packages rely on.

It has **zero dependency**, and should work _everywhere_ (client and server notably).  
Think of it as a swiss army knife - use it to sharpen your FHIR skills!
