The `@bonfhir/react` package provides [React](https://react.dev/) components to help with building web apps and
native mobile applications (with [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/)).

**These components are render-less** - which means that they can be customized to render the exact way that you want, and
can be used with different toolkits.

bonFHIR presently ships with renderers for the [Mantine toolkit](/packages/react/mantine), and preliminary support for
[Gluestack UI](https://gluestack.io/) for React Native.
