import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';

Create a simple API hosted as an [AWS Lambda function](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) that can react to changes in FHIR resources
using [FHIR Subscriptions](https://hl7.org/fhir/R4B/subscription.html).

These guides will walk you through key BonFHIR concepts and every step of the process,
from setup to a ready to deploy AWS Lambda application.

### What you'll need

- [Node.js v18+](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
